Intagram Group Dynamics analyzes connections between different Instagram accounts and visualizes them. It differenciates between follows and tags, whereas tags are more important as people must have actually interacted with the other person.

It uses Osintgram (https://github.com/Datalux/Osintgram) to get the required data from Instagram.
To set up Osintgram check out the README on https://github.com/Datalux/Osintgram.
